# Block Party / Asynch Stand-Ups

### Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

Collaboration is rampant in web development because most projects are too large for one person to build and maintain alone. Companies use a wide variety of methods for collaboration, and we'd like you to get practice with a variety of methods, as well.

We've emphasized pair programming because it's a very valuable skill and a new skill for most people. You've also done stand-ups. Most companies hold some kind of stand-up meetings within each engineering team.

You're working on independent projects today, so pairing isn't a good go-to collaboration method.  Still, as a cohort we're all on the same (large!) "team".  **Asynchronous stand-ups** are a good solution for large teams and teams, teams  that have engineers working very independently on similar problems.

### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*Developers will be able to:*

- Practice asking technical questions as expected in a work environment.
- Practice responding to requests for technical help.

### Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Developers should already be able to:*

- Pair program as a "driver" or "navigator".
- Describe their progress in stand-ups.

### How to Ask Technical questions

Whether you're asking a colleague immediate help with a problem in your code, adding an issue to your project's GitHub repo, or reporting a bug in some external code, include these helpful pieces of information:

1. What do you want/expect?  What *should* happen?
 > When a user clicks the "sign up" button, a login form should pop up.

1. What is happening instead?
  > When a user clicks the "sign up" button, nothing happens on the screen, and there are no errors in the console.

1. What have you tried to get the desired result?
  > * Googled the issue ("button click doesn't do anything")
  > * Looked back at documentation for click handling
  > * Added a console.log to the click handler

### Asynchronous Stand-ups

Asynchronous stand-ups are often conducted through slack or a similar tool.  We definitely encourage you to use slack to express blocks and share tips.

We're also going to have a physical block party!

1. Think of an issue you've solved recently or a block you're facing right now.  
1. Write your block on the walls of the classroom, including what you want/expect to happen and what is happening instead.  (You don't need to include all the things you've tried.)  
1. When you solve the problem, write "solved" or ":)" or a brief tip next to your block.

### Getting and Receiving Help

1. Periodically check the wall to see if anyone else is facing the same block or if someone has solved it.  
1. If you think someone may be able to help you, start by preparing the three parts of a technical question above. You can then slack the person to ask for help. _They_ will evaluate whether and how they can help you based on their time and resources.  
1. If you don't think any classmates have faced this issue, or if you've asked a classmate and they weren't able to help, go to the teaching team!

1. If someone slacks you asking for help, _you_ get to evaluate how to help them.  All of the following are 100% acceptable options:
  * set a time to meet with the person and go over the topic  
  * slack a resource link  
  * give a quick tip that helped you (even "check your spelling!")
  * refer the person to someone else who helped you (like a teaching team member)
  * let the person know that you don't have time to help or your issue doesn't seem related
